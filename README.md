# Preliminary Models of SNAP Error Rates

This repository contains data and code to reproduce a preliminary analysis for
how well state policies can explain SNAP error rates. A full description of the
methodology and preliminary results are available in:
[SNAP Error Rate Modeling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNUsgYA81ChnMRFV03Elat1qz8kdMfGiLd08wDqRo5I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mtc4swvlio8d)

## Running

To run the analysis, install the required python packages in a virtual environment
and execute the runner script with:

    python3.12 -m venv ~/envs/snap-error-rates
    source ~/envs/snap-error-rates/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    bash run.sh
